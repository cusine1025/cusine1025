- ğŸ‘‹ Hello world! I'm Woojin Kim.

- ğŸ‘€ I'm interested in machine learning, especially AI development.
- But that doesn't mean I'm not capable of other things; I can make macroes, apps, and API projects.

- ğŸŒ± My main language is Python, but I can handle JS too.

- ğŸ“« For contact, my email address is 'kwoojin05@gmail.com'.

- Thank you!
